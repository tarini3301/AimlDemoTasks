# AI & ML Internship - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Overview
This project focuses on the essential data cleaning and preprocessing steps required for machine learning workflows. The goal is to prepare raw data for building accurate and robust ML models.

---

## Task Objectives
- Import and explore the dataset (checking for null values, data types, etc.)
- Handle missing values using techniques like mean, median, or imputation
- Convert categorical features into numerical format using encoding methods
- Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistent scaling
- Visualize and remove outliers using boxplots

---

## Dataset
For this task, the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) is used as an example.  
*(You can use any other dataset relevant to this task.)*

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## What You Will Learn
- Data cleaning and handling null values
- Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)
- Feature scaling: normalization vs standardization
- Outlier detection and removal
- Importance of preprocessing in machine learning pipelines

---

## Code Example (Snippet)
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Titanic.csv')

# Basic data exploration
print(df.info())
print(df.isnull().sum())
print(df.describe(include='all'))
